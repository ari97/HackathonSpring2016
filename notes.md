Ok so I put a lot of stuff on slack to ariel.  this is including a voteing algorthym
I wrote on the board as to what we can do for sorting the differnt votes for a score
I htink we could assume around 50 ish votes as a peak for top ideas (based off of yic yak)
Posts should have a time that the most recient edit was made jsut for clarifications sake
I want to orgnize all the files in differnt folders (the png files in a images folder...)
I added a time to the posts apparentally tehres a DATETIME
